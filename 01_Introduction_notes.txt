	4.Data manupulation is very fast.

- DBMS (Database Management System):
	DBMS is a way to achieve the database concept using various IDE's(Integrated Development Environment).
	1. Relational Database Management System.
	2. Hierarchial Database Management System.
	3. Network Database Management System.
	4. Object Oriented Database Management System.

- Database => DBMS => RDBMS => SQL

- RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):
	In RDBMS, Data is stored in rows and columns i.e in table.
	1. Relations = tables
	2. Tuple = rows
	3. Attributes = columns

	2. DML (Data Manupulation Language)
	3. TCL & DCL (Transaction Control Language & Data Control Language)

- Datatypes in SQL:
	1. char: store character value
	2. varchar: store character value
	3. integer: store integer value
	4. decimal: store decimal value
