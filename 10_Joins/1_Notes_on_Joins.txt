SQL(Structured Query Language)

- SQL Joins:
    Join is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

- For doing join operations, atleast one column must be common in tables (Relations)

- Types of Joins:
    1. Inner Join
    2. Outer Join:
        a. Left outer join (left join)
        b. Right outer join (right join)
        c. Full outer join (full join)
    3. Cross Join
    4. Self Join

- Inner join:
    Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
    Rejects unmatching rows.
    Syntax: 
        SELECT column(s)
        FROM tableA
        INNER JOIN tableB
        ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

- Outer Join:
1. Left outer join (left join):
    Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    Syntax: 
        SELECT column(s)
        FROM tableA
        LEFT JOIN tableB
        ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

2. Right outer join (right join):
    Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    Syntax: 
        SELECT column(s)
        FROM tableA
        RIGHT JOIN tableB
        ON tableA.col_name = tableB.col_name;

3. Full outer join (full join):
    Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.
    Full join is union of left and right join. 
    (LEFT JOIN  UNION  RIGHT JOIN)

- Cross Join:
    A cross join, also known as a Cartesian product (cross product).
    It generates a result set that contains all possible combinations of rows from both tables.
    Syntax: 
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1
        CROSS JOIN table2;

- Self Join:
    It is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.
    Syntax:
        SELECT columns
        FROM table1 AS alias1
        JOIN table1 AS alias2 ON alias1.column = alias2.column;
